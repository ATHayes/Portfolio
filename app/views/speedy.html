            <h1>Speedy Deliveries</h1>
            <p class = brief>"Speedy Deliveries" is a consortium of 5 van owners and drivers who have joined together to pool their resources and compete locally against some of the larger logistics providers. While each member is independent, they have decided to join together in order to share costs such as a central office with a base operator, advertising etc.
</p>
			<p class="brief">You have been asked to design a program to manage the information generated by the business more effectively. "Speedy Deliveries" require an interface that will allow the operator to access information on the staff and customers, and will manage deliveries on a daily basis.</p>
